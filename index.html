            <p>
                This article will cover the differences between Java and Python
                and their machine learning implementations. It will examine the pros
                and cons of each as well as explore how they can be used in a
                business context.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Analysis and Processing</h2>
            <p>
                This is where the process starts. Data analysis and processing is one
                of the most important steps in machine learning. In essence, it's
                taking data and turning it into something useful. It starts with filling
                in any missing data because a machine learning model can't work properly
                with an incomplete dataset. Next, the data needs to be put into a form
                that the code will understand. This process can involve any combination
                of imputing, encoding, scaling, and more(cite steps of ml). We will cover some of these 
                later on. Once this is done, our data processing is done. So how can Java 
                and Python help us do this? And how does this apply to businesses?
            </p>

            <h3>Data Processing for Business</h3>
            <p>
                Have you ever taken a survey about a product or yourself? Chances are, you
                have. Let's say a business wants to know more about it's employee salaries.
                They want to examine differences between pay for different genders and ages
                of their employees. Some employees may not want to share their age or gender,
                so the business needs to find a way to handle this missing data. Data processing
                can accomplish this by imputing the data. Now that they have all of the data
                filled in, they can use it to make calculations. Businesses will often need more
                than just data imputation. One common thing used when processing data is called
                normalization/standardization. Normalization adjusts the scale of features to
                ensure they have a similar range/distribution. This ensures that no single feature
                will dominate the model due to its scale. This will apply in the model we create
                later in the article.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Processing with Java</h3>
            <p>
                Java is a very verbose language. This means it takes lots of code to do some
                things compared to other languages. Java also does not have many built in
                libraries for data processing which means there's a bit more manual work to do.
                Java makes up for this with it's security, multithreading capabilities, and 
                fast runtimes (cite py vs java for ml). Each of these are important for a machine learning project,
                especially on a large scale like a business will have. Java accomplishes its
                security largely through the Java Virtual Machine. Code is compiled into
                bytecode which can be executed on any machine. Then, bytecode verification
                is performed before the program is executed to make sure the code is safe.
                The JVM and bytecode compilation are also big reasons for why Java is so fast.
                Java compilation does not consume processor or memory resources, which is a big
                advantage when using it for machine learning and an even bigger advantage for
                businesses who need to be very careful allocating their resources. (cite why java is secure)
            </p>
            <p>
                The below example shows a simple process. In a list of employees,
                it finds the average salary of every employee over the age of 30.
                This is a very basic example of data processing.
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="language-java">
// Java Example: Finding the average salary of people over 30 years old
public class DataAnalysis {
    List&lt;Person&gt; persons = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    try (CSVReader reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(filepath))){
        String[] line;
        reader.readNext();
        while ((line = reader.readNext()) != null) {
            String name = line[0];
            int age = Integer.parseInt(line[1]);
            double salary = Double.parseDouble(line[2]);
            persons.add(new Person(name, age, salary));
        }
    } catch (CsvValidationException | IOException e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    double avg = persons.stream().filter(person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 30)
                    .mapToDouble(Person::getSalary)
                    .average().orElse(0.0);
    System.out.printf("Average salary for people over 30: $%.2f%n", avg);
}
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Data Processing with Python</h3>
            <p>
                Python is not nearly as verbose as Java. Throughout this article, this will
                be clear in each example. This makes it very simple to write code for
                machine learning. It also has a diverse selection of libraries to help streamline
                this process further. While Python has advantages that make it easier to write
                code, it is not without faults. Python uses an interpreter to run its code,
                which means the program is compiled line-by-line. This makes Python much slower 
                than Java. Businesses must consider whether it is worth it to have faster runtimes
                or faster development times when chosing between languages. (cite py vs java for ml)
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
# Python Example: Analyzing salary data with pandas
import pandas as pd

ds = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
filtered = ds[ds['Age'] > 30]
avg = filtered['Salary'].mean()

print(f"Average salary for people over 30: ${avg:.2f}")
            </code></pre>
            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Machine Learning is being used more and more throughout businesses today. Some common
                uses are personalized customer service, fraud detection, retail shelf analysis, and
                many more (cite 8 ways). But, what is "machine learning"? How does a machine learn? How do programming
                languages accomplish this? Well, Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence.
                It uses data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn. This is accomplished in one
                of three ways: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. We will focus on
                supervised learning in this article. Supervised learning uses labeled data to classify or
                predict outcomes. The model will adjust its weights until it's fitted appropriately and
                can give an accurate value. In this article, we will build a Logistic Regression model
                which is used to give a "yes/no" answer to a question. This is done with a combination of
                linear algebra and an algorithm called "gradient descent". This article will not cover the
                math behind it, but it will cover the code. (cite IBM)
            </p>

            <h3>Logisitic Regression with Java</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned before, Java does not have as many libraries to make machine learning as smooth
                as Python. In Java, the math may have to be done by hand, which is almost what we'll do here.
                Since Java is much more verbose than Python and some other languages, development times will
                likely increase when making models with Java. This comes with the upside that models in Java
                are much more performant, secure, and scalable for future technological advancements (cite py vs java). To show
                this, we will create a simple Logistic Regression model in Java. This model will be used to
                predict whether a person is likely to purchase something based on the country they live in,
                their age, and their salary. We will also test the accuracy of the model.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-java">
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    // Load the data from the CSV file
    // Imputing missing values is done here
    List&lt;double[]&gt; temp = LoadCSV.loadData(csvPath);
    double[][] data = temp.toArray(new double[0][]);
    double[][] X = new double[data.length][data[0].length-1];
    double[] y = new double[data.length];

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++){
        System.arraycopy(data[i], 0, X[i], 0, data[i].length-1);
        y[i] = data[i][data[i].length-1];
    }
    // Standardizes range of data
    X = normalize(X);

    // Split the data into a training and test set
    int trainSize = (int) (0.8 * X.length);
    double[][] X_train = new double[trainSize][];
    double[] y_train = new double[trainSize];
    double[][] X_test = new double[X.length-trainSize][];
    double[] y_test = new double[X.length-trainSize];

    System.arraycopy(X, 0, X_train, 0, trainSize);
    System.arraycopy(y, 0, y_train, 0, trainSize);
    System.arraycopy(X, trainSize, X_test, 0, X.length-trainSize);
    System.arraycopy(y, trainSize, y_test, 0, y.length-trainSize);

    // Train the model
    LogisticRegressionModel model = new LogisticRegressionModel(0.1, 1000);
    model.train(X_train, y_train);

    int[] predictions = model.predict(X_test);

    // Show Accuracy
    double accuracy = model.computeAccuracy(toIntArray(y_test), predictions);
    System.out.println("Model Accuracy: " + accuracy);

            <h3>Logistic Regression with Python</h3>
            <p>
                Python's extensive libraries make it so that none of the math has to be done by hand. Common
                processes are made into simple functions that make Machine Learning with Python easy to learn
                and use. Businesses often use Python for these reasons. It's much easier for developers to
                make machine learning models in Python, which decreases development times, update times, and
                testing/debugging times. In this model, we will use common machine learning libraries including
                NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to accomplish the same task as the model in Java.
            </p>

# Load and format data
data = pd.read_csv("Data.csv")
X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = data.iloc[:, -1].values

# Fill missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')
imputer.fit(X[:, 1:3])
X[:, 1:3] = imputer.transform(X[:, 1:3])

# Encode the home country into a numerical value
ct = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[('encoder', OneHotEncoder(), [0])], remainder='passthrough')
X = np.array(ct.fit_transform(X))

# Encode the purchase outcome into a numerical value
le = LabelEncoder()
y = le.fit_transform(y)

# Split into training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)

# Normalize data

X_train[:, 3:] = scaler.fit_transform(X_train[:, 3:])
X_test[:, 3:] = scaler.transform(X_test[:, 3:])
